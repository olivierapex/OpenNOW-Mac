/// 1. RTSPS-over-WSS control channel to the seat's `:322` endpoint (OPTIONS → DESCRIBE → SETUP).
/// 2. The video handoff is *derived* from those answers — it never arrives through signaling —
///    including the SRTP master key, which this client generates and ANNOUNCEs itself.
/// 3. The raw-SRTP Mjolnir socket starts receiving before ANNOUNCE (Bifrost arms

/// Input, audio and the RTCP feedback plane ride the ICE/DTLS bundle's SCTP data channels, which
/// this transport brings up through `NvstNativeBundle` when the seat negotiates the official
/// cloud path; the bare Mjolnir socket keeps carrying video and its own SRTCP reports on the
/// legacy shape. Microphone carriage is server-driven: when the seat offers
/// `general.rtcMicOnNativeBundle:1` in DESCRIBE, the bundle gains a sendonly `m=audio` mic
/// section (the vendor's own mic-on-bundle shape) negotiated at bring-up from the configuration
/// the host applies before `start`, announced by echoing the offer plus the sender SSRC
/// (`x-nv-mic.micSsrcConfig.senderSsrc`) since NVST has no SDP transport for the seat to learn
/// it from. Production seats run the legacy RTSP mic transport instead — not yet recovered.
/// This is the only transport. `OPN_NVST_BIFROST_FREE` and the
