//  The native NVST stream session: starting it, tearing it down, and everything the HUD can do to
//  it while it runs - microphone, anti-AFK, pointer lock, video enhancement, stats polling and the
//  network governor.
//
//  All of this was `@State` and `private func` inside `NativeNVSTMediaStreamSurface`, a SwiftUI
//  view: 52 stored properties, 60 methods and 18 task or timer sites owning a live stream session,
//  none of it reachable without rendering the stream.
//
//  Teardown order is load-bearing and was moved verbatim. In particular the Metal view is never
//  hidden before the native session is destroyed - doing so wedges the render loop and deadlocks
//  shutdown - and `didEnd` is a once-guard that must not be reset while a session can still end.
